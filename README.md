# Scatter Plot with Regression Line

This repository contains Python code for generating a scatter plot with a linear regression line. The analysis demonstrates the relationship between two variables \( X \) and \( Y \) and provides visual insights into their correlation.

## Description

The project includes:

- **Scatter Plot**: Visual representation of data points.
- **Linear Regression Line**: A fitted line that models the relationship between \( X \) and \( Y \).
- **Estimation**: Calculation of \( Y \) values for given \( X \) values using the linear regression model.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis consists of the following values:

| \( X \) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| \( Y \) | 70 | 50 | 40 | 30 | 20 | 10 |

## Code

The provided Python code calculates the linear regression parameters and generates the scatter plot with the regression line.

### Dependencies

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
